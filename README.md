**AI Powered Presidential Election -  Can you convince an AI journalist to back your candidate for the election and become the next President of the United States?**

**Gameplay description:**
You begin by choosing the name of your candidate for the Presidental election.  In this game you are playing as  the campaign strategist for said candidate. After this you will be prompted by the AI journalist to answer challenging political questions, which you must answer.  Your popularity will increase or decrease based on how convincing the argumentation is. You must have popularity score of over 70 after 10 weeks of questions to win the election. Seems straightforward enough, but there's a catch.   On top of the popularity meter you also need to watch out for your bias score: The AI journalist will try to figure out whether you are being insincere or manipulative and adjust the bias rating accordingly. If your bias rating reaches 100% the AI journalist exposes you and you lose immediately. So you need to sound convincing without compromising your integrity by getting caught lying.
Other features include a map of the states that show which of the states you currently have a majority popularity in.
